angularjs-gulp-browserify-boilerplate
=====================================

This project is developed for sole purpose of Demo


A boilerplate using AngularJS, SASS, Gulp, and Browserify that also utilizes [these best AngularJS practices](https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide)  and Gulp best practices from 


---
## Getting Started

First Install development dependencies, ensure you have nodejs installed and install the following tools:

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) command line utility:

  `npm install -g gulp`

[Bower](http://bower.io/) command line utility:
  
  `npm install -g bower`

###Ensure node tools and gulp plugins are up to date:

  `npm install`

will install dependencies defined in **package.json** file

  `bower install`

will install front end dependencies defined in **bower.json** file.

## Tasks

- To see a list of options tasks and sub tasks

  `gulp`

- To build project files for development, serve browser and watch all project files:

  `gulp serve`


## Usage

### Node Modules
  
  - `/node_modules` is a dynamic directory where npm modules are installed.

  - `package.json` is the configuration file for npm modules.

### Bower
 
 - `/bower_components` is a dynamic directory where bower components are installed.

 -  `bower.json` is the configuration file for your bower components.


### Application files

The `/src` directory should contain all the files needed for the application.

  - `src/app` all files related to the application.

    - `src/app/modules` modules that are dependencies of the `easy sign` module.

    - `src/app/views` `easy sign` views.

  - `src/assets` all `easy sign` images.

  - `src/sass` top level styles for `easy sign`.

    - `src/sass/styles.scss` all SASS files should be imported through here.


This boilerplate uses the latest versions of the following libraries:

- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)

Along with many Gulp libraries (these can be seen in either `package.json`, or at the top of each task in `/gulp/tasks/`).

---

### AngularJS

AngularJS is a MVW (Model-View-Whatever) Javascript Framework for creating single-page web applications. In this boilerplate, it is used for all the application routing as well as all of the frontend views and logic.

The AngularJS files are all located within `/app/js`, structured in the following manner:

```
/controllers
  index.js   (the main module on which all controllers will be mounted, loaded in main.js)
  example.js
/directives
  index.js   (the main module on which all directives will be mounted, loaded in main.js)
  example.js
/filters
  index.js (the main module on which all filters will be mounted, loaded in main.js)
  example.js
/services
  index.js   (the main module on which all services will be mounted, loaded in main.js)
  example.js
constants.js  (any constant values that you want to make available to Angular)
main.js       (the main file read by Browserify, also where the application is defined and bootstrapped)
on_run.js     (any functions or logic that need to be executed on app.run)
on_config.js  (all route definitions and any logic that need to be executed on app.config)
templates.js  (this is created via Gulp by compiling your views, and will not be present beforehand)
```

##### Module organization

Controllers, services, directives, etc. should all be placed within their respective folders, and will be automatically required and mounted via their respective `index.js` using `bulk-require`. All modules must export an object of the format:

```javascript
const ExampleModule = function() {};

export default {
  name: 'ExampleModule',
  fn: ExampleModule
};

```

##### Dependency injection

Dependency injection is carried out with the `ng-annotate` library. In order to take advantage of this, a simple directive prologue of the format:

```js
function MyService($http) {
  'ngInject';
  ...
}
```

needs to be added at the very beginning of any Angular functions/modules. The Gulp tasks will then take care of adding any dependency injection, requiring you to only specify the dependencies within the function parameters and nothing more.

---

### SASS

SASS, standing for 'Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets', is a CSS extension language adding things like extending, variables, and mixins to the language. This boilerplate provides a barebones file structure for your styles, with explicit imports into `app/styles/main.scss`. A Gulp task (discussed later) is provided for compilation and minification of the stylesheets based on this file.

---

### Browserify

Browserify is a Javascript file and module loader, allowing you to `require('modules')` in all of your files in the same manner as you would on the backend in a node.js environment. The bundling and compilation is then taken care of by Gulp, discussed below.

---

### Gulp

Gulp is a "streaming build system", providing a very fast and efficient method for running your build tasks.

##### Web Server

Gulp is used here to provide a very basic node/Express web server for viewing and testing your application as you build. It serves static files from the `build/` directory, leaving routing up to AngularJS. All Gulp tasks are configured to automatically reload the server upon file changes. The application is served to `localhost:3002` once you run the `gulp` task. To take advantage of the fast live reload injection provided by browser-sync, you must load the site at the proxy address (within this boilerplate will by default be `localhost:3000`). To change the settings related to live-reload or browser-sync, you can access the UI at `localhost:3001`.

##### Scripts

A number of build processes are automatically run on all of our Javascript files, run in the following order:

- **JSHint:** Gulp is currently configured to run a JSHint task before processing any Javascript files. This will show any errors in your code in the console, but will not prevent compilation or minification from occurring.
- **Browserify:** The main build process run on any Javascript files. This processes any of the `require('module')` statements, compiling the files as necessary.
- **Babelify:** This uses [babelJS](https://babeljs.io/) to provide support for ES6+ features.
- **Debowerify:** Parses `require()` statements in your code, mapping them to `bower_components` when necessary. This allows you to use and include bower components just as you would npm modules.
- **ngAnnotate:** This will automatically add the correct dependency injection to any AngularJS files, as mentioned previously.
- **Uglifyify:** This will minify the file created by Browserify and ngAnnotate.

The resulting file (`main.js`) is placed inside the directory `/build/js/`.

##### Styles

Just one plugin is necessary for processing our SASS files, and that is `gulp-sass`. This will read the `main.scss` file, processing and importing any dependencies and then minifying the result. This file (`main.css`) is placed inside the directory `/build/css/`.

- **gulp-autoprefixer:** Gulp is currently configured to run autoprefixer after compiling the scss.  Autoprefixer will use the data based on current browser popularity and property support to apply prefixes for you. Autoprefixer is recommended by Google and used in Twitter, WordPress, Bootstrap and CodePen.

##### Images

Any images placed within `/app/images` will be automatically copied to the `build/images` directory. If running `gulp prod`, they will also be compressed via imagemin.

##### Views

When any changes are made to the `index.html` file, the new file is simply copied to the `/build/` directory without any changes occurring.

Files inside `/app/views/`, on the other hand, go through a slightly more complex process. The `gulp-angular-templatecache` module is used in order to process all views/partials, creating the `template.js` file briefly mentioned earlier. This file will contain all the views, now in Javascript format inside Angular's `$templateCache` service. This will allow us to include them in our Javascript minification process, as well as avoid extra HTTP requests for our views.

##### Watching files

All of the Gulp processes mentioned above are run automatically when any of the corresponding files in the `/app` directory are changed, and this is thanks to our Gulp watch tasks. Running `gulp dev` will begin watching all of these files, while also serving to `localhost:3002`, and with browser-sync proxy running at `localhost:3000` (by default).

##### Production Task

Just as there is the `gulp dev` task for development, there is also a `gulp prod` task for putting your project into a production-ready state. This will run each of the tasks, while also adding the image minification task discussed above. There is also an empty `gulp deploy` task that is included when running the production task. This deploy task can be fleshed out to automatically push your production-ready site to your hosting setup.

**Reminder:** When running the production task, gulp will not fire up the express server and serve your index.html. This task is designed to be run before the `deploy` step that may copy the files from `/build` to a production web server.

##### Pre-compressing text assets

When running with `gulp prod`, a pre-compressed file is generated in addition to uncompressed file (.html.gz, .js.gz, css.gz). This is done to enable web servers serve compressed content without having to compress it on the fly. Pre-compression is handled by `gzip` task.
